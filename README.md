## A collection of mathematical functions that I use in my classes
I use SBCL with ASDF. Your mileage with other implementations may vary.

### A note on factorials

The factorial algorithm I use comes directly from
[a paper by Richard Fateman](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~fateman/papers/factorial.pdf)
beacuse I got tired of reading through confusing resources. If you want to
implement a better one, you might read:

* http://numbers.computation.free.fr/Constants/Algorithms/splitting.html
* http://www.luschny.de/math/factorial/SwingFactorialPy.html
* http://www.luschny.de/math/factorial/conclusions.html
* http://www.luschny.de/math/factorial/SwingFactorialSagePython.html
* https://oeis.org/A000142/a000142.pdf

(I am not in any way affiliated with any of these resources, nor do I understand
a significant amount of the code or text they contain.
